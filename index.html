        Windows Console is the infrastructure for console applications in Microsoft Windows.
         An instance of a Windows Console has a screen buffer and an input buffer.
          It allows console apps to run inside a window or in hardware text mode.
         The user can switch between the two using the Alt+â†µ Enter key combination.
         A console is the combination of a monitor and keyboard. It is a rudimentary interface
          in which the monitor provides the output and the keyboard is used for input. ...
           Modern consoles often provide a graphical interface that can be used to control machines
            on a local network (LAN) or provide remote access to remote systems.
            The Windows Console is available from the Start Button on the Taskbar;
             it is called 'Command Prompt' or 'MSDOS Prompt' depending on the OS;
              the almost undecipherable icon actually contains the letters of "MSDOS".
             Click on the menu, and a Console window will appear.
             You should use the console. log() method to print to console JavaScript.
              The JavaScript console log function is mainly used for code debugging as
               it makes the JavaScript print the output to the console. To open the browser console,
              right-click on the page and select Inspect, and then click Console.
